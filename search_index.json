And while at first he very rarely discouraged going down new paths, he became quick to warn me against rabbit holes when he realized my inability to avoid them. His occasionally uncanny insights often lead me to wonder whether he’s been hiding the answers all along. My co-advisor Dr Patrick Jaynes is always willing to provide feedback on everything I write, however hopeless or trivial the draft may be. I very much appreciate his thoughtfulness in asking just the right questions whenever I lack the capacity for words. I must also thank the patience and ingenuity of anyone who’s ever taught me. While I won’t rattle off all of my teachers since preschool, I am certaintly grateful to every one of my teachers since preschool. Objective The broad scope of this project is to correlate gene signatures with the infiltration of specific immune cell types. The presence of certain immune cells in the tumor microenvironment seem to have an influence on prognosis in DLBCL. In order to develop novel therapies to modulate immune cell infiltration and improve prognosis, there is a need to identify processes/signaling pathways that promote the infiltration of specific immune cells and in addition, understand if there are any key differences in the regulation cells that can be exploited for this purpose. In addition, while the mechanism of action is still unclear, preliminary data suggests that STING protein promotes a favorable prognosis in DLBCL. Understanding the role STING plays in immune cell infiltration would help us characterize the features of a ‘high-STING’ tumor to understand how this protein promotes a favorable prognosis. Overall, the objectives of this project are to understand the intracellular signals that regulate immune phenotypes in DLBCL and the role of STING in promoting a favorable prognosis and its regulation of immune cell infiltration. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Modulation of the immune system plays a key role in modern cancer treatment (Pulendran &amp; Davis, 2020). DLBCL is the most common aggressive lymphoma, affecting both young and elderly adults (Li, Young, &amp; Medeiros, 2018). The prognosis of DLBCL is influenced by the immune microenvironment which plays a key role in the prognosis of DLBCL (Autio et al., 2021). For instance, M2 macrophages might have a lymphoma-promoting function in DLBCL and predict poor clinical outcomes, unlike M1 macrophages (Nam et al., 2014). Using bioinformatic techniques we can then gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells. To facilitate the investigation of the roles of various immune cells in tumors, various computational methods (Abbas, Wolslegel, Seshasayee, Modrusan, &amp; Clark, 2009) have been developed, particularly for deconvoluting bulk gene expression profiles that will allow us to estimate various cell compositions. The idea behind such computational approaches is to treat bulk expression profiles as a linear or additive combination of the expression profiles of several cell subsets, and thus recover the fractions of different types of cells. Applying immune deconvolution algorithms on DLBCL datasets would allow us to examine the fraction of immune cells present in tumor samples and hence help us gauge the extent of immune cell infiltration. Further downstream bioinformatic analysis such as Gene set enrichment or pathway analysis can help us gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells. Chemotherapy treatment has also been found to play a role in immune cell recruitment. A key mediator of chemotherapy-induced immune signaling is the Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway mediates the interplay between the cytotoxic effect and immune stimulation by detecting DNA damage-induced micronuclei or cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and promoting antitumor immune responses (Valmori et al., 2002). Understanding the role of STING in mediating an immune response as a cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensor would give us insight into the immune microenvironment in the context of DLBCL. Further, we have preliminary evidence that indicates that STING promote a favorable prognosis in DLBCL thus we reasoned that this protein could be a key determinant of immunogenicity in DLBCL References Abbas, A.

The GOYA trial tested the efficacy of Gazyva (GA101) compared with Rituxan (Rituximab) in first line, untreated DLBCL patients. Dave dataset (Reddy et al., 2017) This dataset contain exome sequencing data for 1001 DLBCL patients and RNA sequencing data for 775 DLBCL patients. Staudt dataset (Schmitz et al., 2018) This retrospective study included 181 clinical samples from CHOP-treated patients and 233 clinical samples from Rituximab-CHOP-treated patients. The following microarray datasets were choosen for analysis - 1.2 Immunedeconvolution Immune deconvolution by the following methods was conducted for the chosen datasets. quanTIseq (Finotello et al., 2019) Computational pipeline for the quantification of the Tumor Immune contexture from human RNA-seq data CIBERSORT (Chen, Khodadoust, Liu, Newman, &amp; Alizadeh, 2018) CIBERSORT takes an input matrix of reference gene expression signatures which is collectively used to estimate the relative proportions of each cell type of interest. CIBERSORT exhibits substantially improved accuracy for the analysis of mixture MCP - Counter (Becht et al., 2016) Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) method, allows the quantification of the absolute abundance of eight immune and two stromal cell populations in heterogeneous tissues from transcriptomic data. xCell (Widodo et al., 2021) xCell, a gene signature-based method that can be used to infer 64 immune and stromal cell types. EPIC (Racle &amp; Gfeller, 2020) Estimates the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC) from bulk tumor gene expression data. EPIC is based on a unique collection of RNA-Seq reference gene expression profiles from either circulating immune cells or tumor- infiltrating non-malignant cell types (i.e., immune, stromal and endothelial cells). 1.3 Pathway Analysis CIBERSORT results were chosen for further downstream analysis due to better resolution of the immune subtypes. For each immune subtype, the patient samples were divided into two cohorts (high and low) based on the immune cell subtype infiltration score (CIBERSORT Score). DeSeq2 (Stewart et al., 2020) analysis was conducted to find the differentially expressed genes following which Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005) using Hallmark gene sets was performed. R 4.1.1 and GraphPad PRISM 9 were used for visualization. 1.4 STING correlation analysis The CIBERSORT Score for each immune cell type was divided into quartiles (CIBERSORT high (Q4), Interquartile range (IQR) and CIBERSORT low (Q1)) and correlated with STING TPM counts for each dataset. Violin plots were used to visualize the results. STING expression for each dataset was divided into quartiles and GSEA analysis was performed between Quartile 1 and Quartile 4 in each of the microarray datasets in order to evaluate pathway level differences. 1.5 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics and one way ANOVA tests were conducted using GraphPad PRISM 9 software for evaluating statistical significance of each quartile. FDR &lt; 0.05 and p value &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant for GSEA and GO analysis. Pearson correlation was conducted using R 4.1.1. 1.6 Clustering analysis 25 FGES (Functional Gene Enrichment Signatures) signatures (Kotlov et al., 2021) were used to identify microenvironmental patterns among DLBCL samples, stratified by STING expression (quartile 4 being STING High samples and quartile 1 Low STING samples) by unsupervised dense clustering using the Louvain method for community detection. Datasets GSE117556, GSE32918, GSE10846, GSE23501 and GSE31312 were individually analyzed and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) (Hänzelmann, Castelo, &amp; Guinney, 2013) was conducted to generate activity scores. Intersample similarity of the activity scores was calculated using Pearson correlation. The resulting distance matrix was converted into a graph where each sample formed a node and two nodes formed an edge with weight equal to the pair’s Pearson correlation. To mathematically determine the optimum threshold for observed clusters for each dataset, maximum Calinski Harabasz and Silhouette scores (Wang &amp; Xu, 2019) were used excluding separations with low-populated clusters. The Calinski-Harabasz index, also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion, is the ratio of the sum of between-clusters dispersion and of inter-cluster dispersion for all clusters, the higher the score, the better the performance. This score is fast to compute and the score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated. Silhouette Coefficient or silhouette score is a metric used to calculate the goodness of a clustering technique. Its value ranges from -1 to 1. WIth 1 meaning the clusters are well apart from each other and clearly distinguished. 0 meaning the clusters are indifferent and -1 meaning the clusters are assigned in the wrong way. The Silhouette score was used as validation after computing the Calinski-Harabasz index and optimum threshold was decided. References Becht, E., Giraldo, N.

Normalized enrichment scores (NES) were plotted for each pathway with the size of the data point representing the number of genes enriched for that pathway. A higher NES indicates a more significant enrichment of the pathway. The data points were colour coded with respect to the p-value with the lighter shade implying higher p value and lower statistically significance. DLBCL arises from the germinal center and shows two distinct subtypes: germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are derived from normal germinal-center centroblasts whereas Activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are derived from plasmablasts. (Monti et al., 2005) Certain transformations of the GCB result in malignancy such as deregulation of BCL2, PI3K/mTOR pathway, p53 mutations and MDM2 gain/amplification (Frick, Dörken, &amp; Lenz, 2011). Deregulation of anti apoptotic BCL2 leads to overexpression of BCL2, making the cell resist cell death. ABC DLBCL however, shows constitutive activation of the oncogenic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway as well as de-regulation BCL2 protein (Frick, Dörken, &amp; Lenz, 2011). NF-κB activity is required for normal B cell development and survival. Lymphoid malignancies typically circumvent cell death by activation of the NFkB pathway. In particular for B cells, NFkB activation is seen downstream of several receptors including BCR, CD40, the B-cell–activating factor (BAFF) receptor, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Lam et al., 2008) BCL6, a transcription repressor is also known to play a causative role in lymphomagenesis. STAT3 is a negative transcriptional regulator of BCL6. Sustained STAT3 activity (for proliferation and survival) is seen in ABC DLBCL cells, suggesting that chemoresistance and consequently poorer outcomes, exhibited by ABC DLBCL could be determined by simultaneous activation of both NFkB and STAT3 (Nowakowski &amp; Czuczman, 2015) Further, lymphocytes and lymphoid malignancies depend on cytokine stimulation for growth and survival. B cell microenvironment interaction is influenced by cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 4, IL6, IL10 and IL21 (Béguelin et al., 2020). The GSEA comparisons (Supplementary Material Fig 1a-h) are for DLBCL with high immune cell infiltration vs low immune cell infiltration. Merdan et al (Merdan et al., 2021) evaluated the CIBERSORT deconvolution scores for different immune subtypes and stratified the scores according to clinical risk groups. They established an association between the relative proportions of the immune cell types within subgroups of DLBCL patients by various clinical traits including cell of origin. It was seen that M0 macrophages, memory resting CD4 + T-cells and CD8+ T cells show greater infiltration particularly in GCB DLBCL samples. This could suggest that the pathways (such as complement, inflammatory response for M0, response to DNA damage for CD4+ memory resting and interferon gamma and alpha for CD8+ T cells) that show greater enrichment than STAT3 and NFkB (which are the pathways active in ABC DLBCL) could represent pathways active in GCB DLBCL that drive the infiltration of these cell types. 2.2 STING cGAS Pathway Figure 2.1: STING Pathway Abnormal localization of DNA in the cytosol elicits an immune response through the cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS binds to DNA in the cytosol and converts ATP and GTP into 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP then binds to STING on the ER to trigger STING trafficking to vesicles. cGAMP-bound STING activates the downstream kinases TBK1 and IKK to activate the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively. These transcription factors induce expression of type I IFNs and cytokines, which propagate the immune response in an autocrine and paracrine manner33 2.3 STING Correlation Analysis Through an investigation evaluating the prognostic significance of a set of immunological features reflective of innate and adaptive immunity in DLBCL, the Jeyasekharan lab identified the inflammatory mediator STING as being correlated with a favourable prognosis. The correlation between STING expression and immune cell infiltration was examined for three RNA Seq datasets. The CIBERSORT Scores for each immune cell was divided into CIBERSORT high quartile (Q4), Interquartile range (IQR) and CIBERSORT low quartile (Q1). The TPM counts for STING expression was plotted as a continuous variable for each quartile and one way ANOVA and subsequent p value was used to determine statistical significance. 2.3.1 Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for T cell subtypes Figure 2.2: Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for T cell follicular helper, T cell gamma delta and T cell regulatory immune subtypes for DAVE, GOYA and Staudt dataset 2.3.2 Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for Macrophage subtypes Figure 2.3: Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for M0, M1 and M2 immune subtypes for DAVE, GOYA and Staudt dataset 2.3.3 Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for CD4+ subtypes Figure 2.4: Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for CD4+ memory activated, CD4+ memory resting and CD4+ naive immune subtypes for DAVE, GOYA and Staudt dataset Overall, a positive trend was noticed across immune cells with the CIBERSORT high quartile (Q4) showing higher TPM when compared to the CIBERSORT low quartile (Q1) suggesting a positive correlation between STING expression and immune cell infiltration. Fig 3a captures the trend of the median of STING expression for CIBESORT high quartile being greater than the median of STING expression for the CIBERSORT low quartile across all the datasets with the lighter color indicating higher STING expression. Fig 3b captures the magnitude of difference of STING expression between CIBERSORT high quartile and CIBERSORT low quartile where a lighter color represents a higher magnitude of difference. Both heatmaps confirm the initial trend and hint at the role of STING expression correlating with greater immune cell infiltration. 2.4 STING GSEA Analysis Hayman et al had previously highlighted a role for STING as a modulator for ROS homeostasis that influenced therapeutic sensitivity37 (Fig 4). This was an interesting context to explore to understand if STING high tumors showed enriched genes that influence ROS production. GSEA analysis was conducted using Hallmarks genesets for STING high vs STING low samples of the microarray datasets to understand which pathways were differentially enriched.

There is a very intricate relationship between OxPhos and ROS pathways and future analysis would be to try and understand the interplay between these two pathways and its correlation with prognosis and to establish consistency with Heyman et al. Additionally, there were 22 common pathways across 6 datasets that were enriched in high STING samples (Table 3) and 3 common pathways were enriched in low STING samples (Table 4). Further analysis is required to understand the nature of regulation of these pathways in STING high tumors and possible mechanisms of action and its correlation, if any, with prognosis. 2.5 GAPDH and STING Correlation Chiche et al38 demonstrated that low GAPDH in the Emu MYC mouse model resulted in a dependence on the OxPhos pathway and poorer outcomes with respect to R-CHOP treatment. This is consistent with enriched OxPhos in low STING tumors, which also have a poor prognosis. This led to a hypothesis as to whether STING expression is related to GAPDH expression However, from the above analysis of the Pearson correlation between GAPDH and STING, it is quite clear that there is no relationship between STING and GAPDH expression, which would imply that the mechanism by which low GAPDH caused poor prognosis in DLBCL is unrelated to low STING 2.6 Tumor Clustering Ananlysis Kotlov et al 39 previously sought to characterize and describe the diversity in the DLBCL tumor microenvironment composition. 25 Functional Gene Enrichment Sets (FGES) were generated that represent the cellular subtypes, noncellular components, or biological processes relevant to the tumor microenvironment. An activity score (magnitude to which the particular effect is associated in a subpopulation of cells, i.e. if a gene is highly or lowly expressed in a given sample in the context of the sample population distribution) was generated for each gene set. Following this, 25 Functional Gene Sets were used to reconstruct the tumor microenvironment. Clusters were analyzed using an unsupervised community detection algorithm and four major clusters were obtained. According to the communities enriched the clusters were named - Germinal Center (GC like) due to the presence of FGES from cell types commonly found in germinal centers , Mesenchymal (MS) for the abundance of FGES from stromal cells and ECM pathways, Inflammatory (IN) the presence of FGES associated with inflammatory cells and pathways and Depleted (DP) for overall lower presence of microenvironment-derived FGES. We performed an analogous analysis on datasets- GSE10846, GSE117556, GSE32918, GSE23501 and GSE31312 to understand if there was a correlation between STING expression and microenvironmental clusters. 2.6.1 GSE32918 Clustering 2.6.2 GSE10846 Clustering Calinski criterion optimal number of clusters: 3 Cluster 1 (Inflammatory + Mesenchymal) Cluster 2 (Depleted) Cluster 3 (GC Like) STING High 61 25 19 STING Low 14 47 44 2.6.3 GSE117556 Clustering Calinski criterion optimal number of clusters: 3 Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 STING High 61 25 19 STING Low 14 47 44 2.6.4 GSE23501 Clustering Calinski criterion optimal number of clusters: 2 Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 STING High 61 25 19 STING Low 14 47 44 2.6.5 GSE31312 Clustering Calinski criterion optimal number of clusters: 2 Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 STING High 61 25 19 STING Low 14 47 44 2.7 Cell line analysis References Béguelin, W., Teater, M., Meydan, C., Hoehn, K.

Particularly, STING seems to have an influence on these pathways promoting immune cell infiltration as well as on the immune microenvironment, particularly with ECM components, and further understanding it’s mechanism of action could be potentially important in correlating with prognosis of DLBCL patients.
