And while at first he very rarely discouraged going down new paths, he became quick to warn me against rabbit holes when he realized my inability to avoid them. His uncanny insights often lead me to wonder whether he’s been hiding the answers all along. My co-advisor Dr Patrick Jaynes is always willing to provide feedback on everything I write, however hopeless or trivial the draft may be. I very much appreciate his thoughtfulness in asking just the right questions whenever I lack the capacity for words. I must also thank the patience and ingenuity of anyone who’s ever taught me. While I won’t rattle off all of my teachers since preschool, I am certaintly grateful to every one of my teachers since preschool. Objective The broad scope of this project is to correlate gene signatures with the infiltration of specific immune cell types. The presence of certain immune cells in the tumor microenvironment seem to have an influence on prognosis in DLBCL. In order to develop novel therapies to modulate immune cell infiltration and improve prognosis, there is a need to identify processes/signaling pathways that promote the infiltration of specific immune cells and in addition, understand if there are any key differences in the regulation cells that can be exploited for this purpose. In addition, while the mechanism of action is still unclear, preliminary data suggests that STING protein promotes a favorable prognosis in DLBCL. Understanding the role STING plays in immune cell infiltration would help us characterize the features of a ‘high-STING’ tumor to understand how this protein promotes a favorable prognosis. Overall, the objectives of this project are to understand the intracellular signals that regulate immune phenotypes in DLBCL and the role of STING in promoting a favorable prognosis and its regulation of immune cell infiltration. The long term aim of this project is to use these findings to develop treatment strategies that can be combined with existing chemotherapy regimens to improve the outcome of DLBCL patients. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Modulation of the immune system plays a key role in modern cancer treatment (Pulendran &amp; Davis, 2020). DLBCL is the most common aggressive lymphoma, affecting both young and elderly adults (Li, Young, &amp; Medeiros, 2018). The prognosis of DLBCL is influenced by the immune micro environment (Autio et al., 2021). For instance, M2 macrophages might have a lymphoma-promoting function in DLBCL and predict poor clinical outcomes, unlike M1 macrophages (Nam et al., 2014). Using bioinformatic techniques we can then gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells. To facilitate the investigation of the roles of various immune cells in tumors, various computational methods (Abbas, Wolslegel, Seshasayee, Modrusan, &amp; Clark, 2009) have been developed, particularly for deconvoluting bulk gene expression profiles that will allow us to estimate various cell compositions. The idea behind such computational approaches is to treat bulk expression profiles as a linear or additive combination of the expression profiles of several cell subsets, and thus recover the fractions of different types of cells. Applying immune deconvolution algorithms on DLBCL datasets would allow us to examine the fraction of immune cells present in tumor samples and hence help us gauge the extent of immune cell infiltration. Further downstream bioinformatic analysis such as Gene set enrichment or pathway analysis can help us gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells. Chemotherapy treatment has also been found to play a role in immune cell recruitment. A key mediator of chemotherapy-induced immune signaling is the Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway mediates the interplay between the cytotoxic effect and immune stimulation by detecting DNA damage-induced micronuclei or cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and promoting antitumor immune responses (Valmori et al., 2002). Further, we have preliminary evidence that indicates that STING promote a favorable prognosis in DLBCL thus we reasoned that this protein could be a key determinant of immunogenicity in DLBCL The STING cGAS Pathway Figure 0.1: STING Pathway (Hayman et al., 2021) Abnormal localization of DNA in the cytosol elicits an immune response through the cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS binds to DNA in the cytosol and converts ATP and GTP into 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP then binds to STING on the ER to trigger STING trafficking to vesicles. cGAMP-bound STING activates the downstream kinases TBK1 and IKK to activate the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively. These transcription factors induce expression of type I IFNs and cytokines, which propagate the immune response in an autocrine and paracrine manner (Decout, Katz, Venkatraman, &amp; Ablasser, 2021), (Kwon &amp; Bakhoum, 2020) References Abbas, A.

The GOYA trial tested the efficacy of Gazyva (GA101) compared with Rituxan (Rituximab) in first line, untreated DLBCL patients. Dave dataset (Reddy et al., 2017) This dataset contain exome sequencing data for 1001 DLBCL patients and RNA sequencing data for 775 DLBCL patients. Staudt dataset (Schmitz et al., 2018) This retrospective study included 181 clinical samples from CHOP-treated patients and 233 clinical samples from Rituximab-CHOP-treated patients. The following microarray datasets were choosen for analysis - GSE10846, GSE117556, GSE23501, GSE31312 and GSE32918. 1.2 Immunedeconvolution Immune deconvolution by the following methods was conducted for the chosen datasets. quanTIseq (Finotello et al., 2019) Computational pipeline for the quantification of the Tumor Immune contexture from human RNA-seq data CIBERSORT (Chen, Khodadoust, Liu, Newman, &amp; Alizadeh, 2018) CIBERSORT takes an input matrix of reference gene expression signatures which is collectively used to estimate the relative proportions of each cell type of interest. CIBERSORT exhibits substantially improved accuracy for the analysis of mixture MCP - Counter (Becht et al., 2016) Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) method, allows the quantification of the absolute abundance of eight immune and two stromal cell populations in heterogeneous tissues from transcriptomic data. xCell (Widodo et al., 2021) xCell, a gene signature-based method that can be used to infer 64 immune and stromal cell types. EPIC (Racle &amp; Gfeller, 2020) Estimates the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC) from bulk tumor gene expression data. EPIC is based on a unique collection of RNA-Seq reference gene expression profiles from either circulating immune cells or tumor- infiltrating non-malignant cell types (i.e., immune, stromal and endothelial cells). 1.3 Pathway Analysis CIBERSORT results were chosen for further downstream analysis due to better resolution of the immune subtypes. For each immune subtype, the patient samples were divided into two cohorts (high and low) based on the immune cell subtype infiltration score (CIBERSORT Score). DeSeq2 (Stewart et al., 2020) analysis was conducted to find the differentially expressed genes following which Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005) using Hallmark gene sets was performed. R 4.1.1 and GraphPad PRISM 9 were used for visualization. 1.4 STING correlation analysis The CIBERSORT Score for each immune cell type was divided into quartiles (CIBERSORT high (Q4), Interquartile range (IQR) and CIBERSORT low (Q1)) and correlated with STING TPM counts for each dataset. Violin plots were used to visualize the results. STING expression for each dataset was divided into quartiles and GSEA analysis was performed between Quartile 1 and Quartile 4 in each of the microarray datasets in order to evaluate pathway level differences. 1.5 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics and one way ANOVA tests were conducted using GraphPad PRISM 9 software for evaluating statistical significance of each quartile. FDR &lt; 0.05 and p value &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant for GSEA and GO analysis. Pearson correlation was conducted using R 4.1.1. 1.6 Clustering analysis 25 FGES (Functional Gene Enrichment Signatures) signatures (Kotlov et al., 2021) were used to identify microenvironmental patterns among DLBCL samples, stratified by STING expression (quartile 4 being STING High samples and quartile 1 Low STING samples) by unsupervised dense clustering using the Louvain method for community detection. Datasets GSE117556, GSE32918, GSE10846, GSE23501 and GSE31312 were individually analyzed and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) (Hänzelmann, Castelo, &amp; Guinney, 2013) was conducted to generate activity scores. Intersample similarity of the activity scores was calculated using Pearson correlation. The resulting distance matrix was converted into a graph where each sample formed a node and two nodes formed an edge with weight equal to the pair’s Pearson correlation. To mathematically determine the optimum threshold for observed clusters for each dataset, maximum Calinski Harabasz and Silhouette scores (Wang &amp; Xu, 2019) were used excluding separations with low-populated clusters. The Calinski-Harabasz index, also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion, is the ratio of the sum of between-clusters dispersion and of inter-cluster dispersion for all clusters, the higher the score, the better the performance. This score is fast to compute and the score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated. Silhouette Coefficient or silhouette score is a metric used to calculate the goodness of a clustering technique. Its value ranges from -1 to 1. WIth 1 meaning the clusters are well apart from each other and clearly distinguished. 0 meaning the clusters are indifferent and -1 meaning the clusters are assigned in the wrong way. The Silhouette score was used as validation after computing the Calinski-Harabasz index and optimum threshold was decided. References Becht, E., Giraldo, N.

Normalized enrichment scores (NES) were plotted for each pathway with the size of the data point representing the number of genes enriched for that pathway. A higher NES indicates a more significant enrichment of the pathway. The data points were colour coded with respect to the p-value with the lighter shade implying higher p value and lower statistically significance.

Overall this exploratory analysis helped understand if there were differences in the pathways regulated by various immune subtypes and to set the foundation for the pipeline for further downstream analysis. 2.2 STING Correlation Analysis Through an investigation evaluating the prognostic significance of a set of immunological features reflective of innate and adaptive immunity in DLBCL, the Jeyasekharan lab identified the inflammatory mediator STING as being correlated with a favorable prognosis. The correlation between STING expression and immune cell infiltration was examined for three RNA Seq datasets. Exploratory analysis was conducted where the CIBERSORT Score was plotted against the TPM value for STING for each dataset and the Pearson correlation was calculated (Supplementary). This helped us understand which immune cell types are strongly correlated with STING expression. The graphs below summarise the trend between STING expression for the CIBERSORT Score Quartile (Q4 being high CIBERSORT Score and Q1 being Low CIBERSORT Score) for each immune subtype. Immune sub types with very low correlation and that showed no infiltration (predominately low CIBERSORT Score) or STING expression difference between CIBERSORT Quartiles were filtered since we wanted to understand the differences in infiltration with STING expression.

cells with the CIBERSORT high quartile (Q4) showing higher TPM when compared to the CIBERSORT low quartile (Q1) validating a positive correlation between STING expression and immune cell infiltration.

This is consistent with enriched OxPhos in low STING tumors, which also have a poor prognosis. We wanted to understand if low STING drives low GAPDH or vice versa which drives poor prognosis. Figure 2.12: Pearson correlation of STING and GAPDH expression However, from the above analysis of the Pearson correlation between GAPDH and STING, it is quite clear that there is no relationship between STING and GAPDH expression, which would imply that the mechanism by which low GAPDH caused poor prognosis in DLBCL is unrelated to low STING 2.6 Tumor Clustering Ananlysis Kotlov et al previously sought to characterize and describe the diversity in the DLBCL tumor micro environment composition. 25 Functional Gene Enrichment Sets (FGES) were generated that represent the cellular subtypes, non cellular components, or biological processes relevant to the tumor micro environment to virtually reconstruct the tumor micro environment. The LME (Lymphoma Micro environment) was described based on four clusters - Germinal Center (GC like) if there was presence of FGES from cell types commonly found in germinal centers , Mesenchymal (MS) for the abundance of FGES from stromal cells and ECM pathways, Inflammatory (IN) for the presence of FGES associated with inflammatory cells and pathways and Depleted (DP) for overall lower presence of micro environment-derived FGES. We performed an analogous analysis on datasets- GSE10846, GSE117556 and GSE31312 to understand the lymphoma micro environmental signatures to better describe High STING and Low STING tumors. 2.6.1 GSE10846 Clustering Calinski criterion optimal number of clusters: 3 Cluster 1 (Inflammatory + Mesenchymal) Cluster 2 (Depleted) Cluster 3 (GC Like) STING High 61 25 19 STING Low 14 47 44 2.6.2 GSE117556 Clustering Calinski criterion optimal number of clusters: 3 Cluster 1 (Inflammatory + GC Like) Cluster 2 (Mesenchymal) Cluster 3 (Depleted) STING High 131 67 33 STING Low 20 91 122 2.6.3 GSE31312 Clustering Calinski criterion optimal number of clusters: 2 Cluster 1 (Inflammatory) Cluster 2 (Depleted) Cluster 3 (Mesenchymal) Cluster 4 (Low expressed GC Like) STING High 38 12 26 41 STING Low 29 47 33 9 "],["3-discussion.html", "Chapter 3 Discussion 3.1 The immune microenvironment of DLBCL 3.2 STING as a recruiter of immune cells 3.3 Pathway level regulation by STING 3.4 STING and its role in the lymophoma microenvrionment", " Chapter 3 Discussion 3.1 The immune microenvironment of DLBCL The tumor microenvironment of DLBCL is known to contribute to tumor progression and immune evasion. The immune microenvironment includes several different cell types such as including NLCs/tumor-associated macrophages(TAMs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes(TILs), regulatory T cells, dendritic cells(DCs), myeloid suppressor cells(MSCs) and endothelial stromal cells, which interact with and are enlisted by malignant cells (Xu et al., 2021). The density of immune cells in the tumor and microenvironment is also known to be associated with prognosis. Merdan et al (Merdan et al., 2021) evaluated the CIBERSORT deconvolution scores for different immune sub types and stratified the scores according to clinical risk groups. Consistent with their results, the CIBERSORT analysis conducted showed that CD8+ T cells, CD4+ memory resting and macrophage populations were notably visible in the TME. Further they also established an association between the relative proportions of the immune cell types within subgroups of DLBCL patients by various clinical traits including cell of origin. DLBCL arises from the germinal center and shows two distinct sub types: germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are derived from normal germinal-center centroblasts whereas Activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are derived from plasmablasts. (Monti et al., 2005) Certain transformations of the GCB result in malignancy such as deregulation of BCL2, PI3K/mTOR pathway, p53 mutations and MDM2 gain/amplification (Frick, Dörken, &amp; Lenz, 2011). Deregulation of anti apoptotic BCL2 leads to overexpression of BCL2, making the cell resist cell death. ABC DLBCL however, shows constitutive activation of the oncogenic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway as well as de-regulation BCL2 protein (Frick, Dörken, &amp; Lenz, 2011). NF-κB activity is required for normal B cell development and survival. Lymphoid malignancies typically circumvent cell death by activation of the NFkB pathway. In particular for B cells, NFkB activation is seen downstream of several receptors including BCR, CD40, the B-cell–activating factor (BAFF) receptor, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Lam et al., 2008) BCL6, a transcription repressor is also known to play a causative role in lymphomagenesis. STAT3 is a negative transcriptional regulator of BCL6. Sustained STAT3 activity (for proliferation and survival) is seen in ABC DLBCL cells, suggesting that chemoresistance and consequently poorer outcomes, exhibited by ABC DLBCL could be determined by simultaneous activation of both NFkB and STAT3 (Nowakowski &amp; Czuczman, 2015) Further, lymphocytes and lymphoid malignancies depend on cytokine stimulation for growth and survival. B cell microenvironment interaction is influenced by cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 4, IL6, IL10 and IL21 (Béguelin et al., 2020). It was seen that M0 macrophages, memory resting CD4 + T-cells and CD8+ T cells show greater infiltration particularly in GCB DLBCL samples. This could suggest that the pathways (such as complement, inflammatory response for M0, response to DNA damage for CD4+ memory resting and interferon gamma and alpha for CD8+ T cells) that show greater enrichment than STAT3 and NFkB (which are the pathways active in ABC DLBCL) could represent pathways active in GCB DLBCL that drive the infiltration of these cell types. 3.2 STING as a recruiter of immune cells Overall, from the analysis it is seen that, T cell sub types - CD4+ memory activated, CD4+ memory resting, CD8+, follicular helper cells and Macrophage sub types - M0, M1 and M2 show consistent difference in STING expression and infiltration across all three datasets. In different tumor models, activation of the cGAS-STING signal pathway was found to be significantly associated with infiltration of macrophages, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, as well as their immune markers (Qi et al., 2020) cGAMP activates the STING pathway, which is responsible for attracting macrophages into the tumor micro environment. M1 macrophages are known to have an anti tumor activity, while M2 are immunosuppressive. The STING pathway in macrophages is activated by NF-κβ and IRF3 followed by production of type I IFN within M1 cells, while another transcriptional factor, STAT6, is activated within M2 cells. STING has also been known to have a role in repolarizing tumor-promoting M2-type macrophages into M1-type macrophages. (Cheng et al., 2018) Seng-Ryong Woo et al (Woo et al., 2014) reported that spontaneous T-cell priming was severely debilitated in STING-deficient and IRF3-deficient mice, which suggests that STING signaling may be necessary for the expansion of T cells. This implies that STING activation could facilitate T-cell priming and activation in the tumor micro environment. STING expression in endothelial cells is also known to be positively correlated with the infiltration level of CD8+ T cells and prolonged survival in several human cancer types (eg. colon and breast cancer) (H. Yang et al., 2019). This suggests that STING activation in endothelial cells is necessary for the infiltration of CTLs. Taken together, STING promotes the infiltration of various immune cells and also has an impact on macrophage polarization suggesting that further study is required to explore if STING can switch the TME from “cold” to “hot” 3.3 Pathway level regulation by STING Hayman et al had previously highlighted a role for STING as a modulator for ROS homeostasis that influenced therapeutic sensitivity (Hayman et al., 2021). This was an interesting context to explore to understand if STING high tumors showed enriched genes that influence ROS production. Figure 3.1: Proposed model of tumor intrinsic STING loss leading to treatment resistant phenotype Oxidative phosphorylation was found to be enriched in low STING samples for datasets GSE10846, GSE117556, GSE32918, GSE23501 (FDR &lt; 0.1). There is a very intricate relationship between OxPhos and ROS pathways and future analysis would be to try and understand the interplay between these two pathways and its correlation with prognosis and to establish consistency with Heyman et al. Additionally, the pathways in common across all datasets included ‘Inflammatory Response,’ ‘IL6 -JAK-STAT3 Signalling’ and ‘Apical Junction’ pathways. The enrichment of inflammatory pathways in high STING samples is consistent with activation of STING promoting chemokine production that recruits several inflammatory factors including M2 tumor associated macrophages (Pépin &amp; Gantier, 2017). Further analysis is required to understand the nature of regulation of these pathways in STING high tumors and possible mechanisms of action and its correlation, if any,with prognosis. The cell line analysis showed a considerable overlap between pathways that were enriched in high STING samples and pathways enriched after chemotherapy treatment. Several studies suggested that activation of the cGAS-STING pathway has additional benefits in promoting immunostimulatory effects of chemotherapy drugs while reducing toxicity. A study by Al-Asmari et al (Al-Asmari et al., 2022) showed that both NF-κB and IRF3 branches are frequently engaged in cancer cells upon genotoxic treatment and that IL-6 induced by DNA damage was partially dependent on STING signaling. This also aligns with the literature supporting that IL-6 and its activation of STAT3 counteracts the effects of radio- and chemotherapy in many cancers (P.-L. Yang, Liu, Li, &amp; Xu, 2020) in line with our hypothesis that the STING pathway increases signalling during chemotherapy. 3.4 STING and its role in the lymophoma microenvrionment The datasets analyzed show a few consistent patterns. Firstly, a common trend of three major clusters is obtained. These are similar to the Depleted, Mesenchymal and Inflammatory clusters previously described by Kotlov et al. Second, STING high samples cluster together showing enriched inflammatory and stromal pathways and STING low samples cluster together showing overall depleted microenvironmental signatures. As mentioned previously the enrichment of inflammatory pathways in the LME for STING high tumors can be attributed to the recruitment of inflammatory factors. Another member of the tumor microenvironment is stromal cells (endothelial cells and fibroblasts) that also express STING genes. Tumor-derived DNA can be transferred from cell to cell by phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in the cytoplasm, inducing type I IFN production.(Pépin &amp; Gantier, 2017) Activation of the STING signaling pathway in stromal cells induces vascular remodeling. Intratumoral STING activation normalizes the tumor vasculature and the tumor microenvironment. After STING activation in tumors, interferon-β (IFN-β) production plays a critical role in angiogenesis. IFN-β, an anti-angiogenic cytokine, inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and capillary network formation, up-regulates vascular normalized gene expression, normalizes the tumor vascular system, promotes CD8+ T cell infiltration, and ultimately enhances antitumor immunity (Pu, Chen, Liu, Zhang, &amp; Shao, 2021).This is reflected in our analysis by samples with high STING expression showing enriched ECM and stromal pathways. Further the survival analysis conducted by Kotlov et al (Kotlov et al., 2021) for the various LME signatures shows that LME-Depleted had the highest proportion of high (4–5) international prognostic index (IPI) scores and analysis of OS by LME indicated significant differences in prognosis from better to poor as follows: MS (P=0.03, vs. GC-like), IN (P=0.0008, vs. MS), and DP (P=0.007, vs. IN) LMEs. This could hint at the role of STING (particularly higher expression of STING) in contributing to a favorable prognosis. This might also suggest a loss/lower STING expression could contribute to an initially immune-rich DLBCL showing an immune-deserted microenvironment associated with disease progression and poorer prognosis.

"],["conclusion.html", "Conclusion", " Conclusion Taken together, the study so far indicates that certain general gene signatures such as interferon gamma, NFkB, STAT3, complement pathway could be intracellular signals that influence immune cell infiltration depending upon cell of origin in DLBCL. Particularly, STING seems to have an influence on these pathways promoting immune cell infiltration as well as on the immune microenvironment, particularly with ECM components, and further understanding it’s mechanism of action could be potentially important in correlating with prognosis of DLBCL patients.
