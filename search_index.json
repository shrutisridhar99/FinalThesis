Normalized enrichment scores (NES) were plotted for each pathway with the size of the data point representing the number of genes enriched for that pathway. A higher NES indicates a more significant enrichment of the pathway. The data points were colour coded with respect to the p-value with the lighter shade implying higher p value and lower statistically significance. DLBCL arises from the germinal center and shows two distinct subtypes: germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are derived from normal germinal-center centroblasts whereas Activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are derived from plasmablasts. (Monti et al., 2005) Certain transformations of the GCB result in malignancy such as deregulation of BCL2, PI3K/mTOR pathway, p53 mutations and MDM2 gain/amplification (Frick, Dörken, &amp; Lenz, 2011). Deregulation of anti apoptotic BCL2 leads to overexpression of BCL2, making the cell resist cell death. ABC DLBCL however, shows constitutive activation of the oncogenic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway as well as de-regulation BCL2 protein (Frick, Dörken, &amp; Lenz, 2011). NF-κB activity is required for normal B cell development and survival. Lymphoid malignancies typically circumvent cell death by activation of the NFkB pathway. In particular for B cells, NFkB activation is seen downstream of several receptors including BCR, CD40, the B-cell–activating factor (BAFF) receptor, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Lam et al., 2008) BCL6, a transcription repressor is also known to play a causative role in lymphomagenesis. STAT3 is a negative transcriptional regulator of BCL6. Sustained STAT3 activity (for proliferation and survival) is seen in ABC DLBCL cells, suggesting that chemoresistance and consequently poorer outcomes, exhibited by ABC DLBCL could be determined by simultaneous activation of both NFkB and STAT3 (Nowakowski &amp; Czuczman, 2015) Further, lymphocytes and lymphoid malignancies depend on cytokine stimulation for growth and survival. B cell microenvironment interaction is influenced by cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 4, IL6, IL10 and IL21 (Béguelin et al., 2020). The GSEA comparisons (Supplementary Material Fig 1a-h) are for DLBCL with high immune cell infiltration vs low immune cell infiltration. Merdan et al (Merdan et al., 2021) evaluated the CIBERSORT deconvolution scores for different immune subtypes and stratified the scores according to clinical risk groups. They established an association between the relative proportions of the immune cell types within subgroups of DLBCL patients by various clinical traits including cell of origin. It was seen that M0 macrophages, memory resting CD4 + T-cells and CD8+ T cells show greater infiltration particularly in GCB DLBCL samples. This could suggest that the pathways (such as complement, inflammatory response for M0, response to DNA damage for CD4+ memory resting and interferon gamma and alpha for CD8+ T cells) that show greater enrichment than STAT3 and NFkB (which are the pathways active in ABC DLBCL) could represent pathways active in GCB DLBCL that drive the infiltration of these cell types. 3.2 STING cGAS Pathway Figure 3.1: STING Pathway Abnormal localization of DNA in the cytosol elicits an immune response through the cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS binds to DNA in the cytosol and converts ATP and GTP into 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP then binds to STING on the ER to trigger STING trafficking to vesicles. cGAMP-bound STING activates the downstream kinases TBK1 and IKK to activate the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively. These transcription factors induce expression of type I IFNs and cytokines, which propagate the immune response in an autocrine and paracrine manner33 3.3 STING Correlation Analysis Through an investigation evaluating the prognostic significance of a set of immunological features reflective of innate and adaptive immunity in DLBCL, the Jeyasekharan lab identified the inflammatory mediator STING as being correlated with a favourable prognosis. The correlation between STING expression and immune cell infiltration was examined for three RNA Seq datasets. The CIBERSORT Scores for each immune cell was divided into CIBERSORT high quartile (Q4), Interquartile range (IQR) and CIBERSORT low quartile (Q1). The TPM counts for STING expression was plotted as a continuous variable for each quartile and one way ANOVA and subsequent p value was used to determine statistical significance. 3.3.1 Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for T cell subtypes Figure 3.2: Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for T cell follicular helper, T cell gamma delta and T cell regulatory immune subtypes for DAVE, GOYA and Staudt dataset 3.3.2 Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for Macrophage subtypes Figure 3.3: Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for M0, M1 and M2 immune subtypes for DAVE, GOYA and Staudt dataset 3.3.3 Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for CD4+ subtypes Figure 3.4: Violin plot of TPM distribution of STING across CIBERSORT quartiles for CD4+ memory activated, CD4+ memory resting and CD4+ naive immune subtypes for DAVE, GOYA and Staudt dataset Overall, a positive trend was noticed across immune cells with the CIBERSORT high quartile (Q4) showing higher TPM when compared to the CIBERSORT low quartile (Q1) suggesting a positive correlation between STING expression and immune cell infiltration. Fig 3a captures the trend of the median of STING expression for CIBESORT high quartile being greater than the median of STING expression for the CIBERSORT low quartile across all the datasets with the lighter color indicating higher STING expression. Fig 3b captures the magnitude of difference of STING expression between CIBERSORT high quartile and CIBERSORT low quartile where a lighter color represents a higher magnitude of difference. Both heatmaps confirm the initial trend and hint at the role of STING expression correlating with greater immune cell infiltration. 3.4 STING GSEA Analysis Hayman et al had previously highlighted a role for STING as a modulator for ROS homeostasis that influenced therapeutic sensitivity37 (Fig 4). This was an interesting context to explore to understand if STING high tumors showed enriched genes that influence ROS production. GSEA analysis was conducted using Hallmarks genesets for STING high vs STING low samples of the microarray datasets to understand which pathways were differentially enriched.

There is a very intricate relationship between OxPhos and ROS pathways and future analysis would be to try and understand the interplay between these two pathways and its correlation with prognosis and to establish consistency with Heyman et al. Additionally, there were 22 common pathways across 6 datasets that were enriched in high STING samples (Table 3) and 3 common pathways were enriched in low STING samples (Table 4). Further analysis is required to understand the nature of regulation of these pathways in STING high tumors and possible mechanisms of action and its correlation, if any, with prognosis. 3.5 GAPDH and STING Correlation Chiche et al38 demonstrated that low GAPDH in the Emu MYC mouse model resulted in a dependence on the OxPhos pathway and poorer outcomes with respect to R-CHOP treatment. This is consistent with enriched OxPhos in low STING tumors, which also have a poor prognosis. This led to a hypothesis as to whether STING expression is related to GAPDH expression However, from the above analysis of the Pearson correlation between GAPDH and STING, it is quite clear that there is no relationship between STING and GAPDH expression, which would imply that the mechanism by which low GAPDH caused poor prognosis in DLBCL is unrelated to low STING 3.6 Tumor Clustering Ananlysis Kotlov et al 39 previously sought to characterize and describe the diversity in the DLBCL tumor microenvironment composition. 25 Functional Gene Enrichment Sets (FGES) were generated that represent the cellular subtypes, noncellular components, or biological processes relevant to the tumor microenvironment. An activity score (magnitude to which the particular effect is associated in a subpopulation of cells, i.e. if a gene is highly or lowly expressed in a given sample in the context of the sample population distribution) was generated for each gene set. Following this, 25 Functional Gene Sets were used to reconstruct the tumor microenvironment. Clusters were analyzed using an unsupervised community detection algorithm and four major clusters were obtained. According to the communities enriched the clusters were named - Germinal Center (GC like) due to the presence of FGES from cell types commonly found in germinal centers , Mesenchymal (MS) for the abundance of FGES from stromal cells and ECM pathways, Inflammatory (IN) the presence of FGES associated with inflammatory cells and pathways and Depleted (DP) for overall lower presence of microenvironment-derived FGES. We performed an analogous analysis on datasets- GSE10846, GSE117556, GSE32918, GSE23501 and GSE31312 to understand if there was a correlation between STING expression and microenvironmental clusters.
