Immune deconvolution by various methods was conducted for the chosen datasets. GOYA DLBCL dataset This dataset contains collected RNASeq data of 552 samples from the GOYA clinical trial. The GOYA trial tested the efficacy of Gazyva (GA101) compared with Rituxan (Rituximab) in first line, untreated DLBCL patients. Dave dataset This dataset contain exome sequencing data for 1001 DLBCL patients and RNA sequencing data for 775 DLBCL patients. Staudt dataset This retrospective study included 181 clinical samples from CHOP-treated patients and 233 clinical samples from Rituximab-CHOP-treated patients.
