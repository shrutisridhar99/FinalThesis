And while at first he very rarely discouraged going down new paths, he became quick to warn me against rabbit holes when he realized my inability to avoid them. His occasionally uncanny insights often lead me to wonder whether he’s been hiding the answers all along. My co-advisor Dr Patrick Jaynes is always willing to provide feedback on everything I write, however hopeless or trivial the draft may be. I very much appreciate his thoughtfulness in asking just the right questions whenever I lack the capacity for words. I must also thank the patience and ingenuity of anyone who’s ever taught me. While I won’t rattle off all of my teachers since preschool, I am certaintly grateful to every one of my teachers since preschool. Objective The broad scope of this project is to correlate gene signatures with the infiltration of specific immune cell types. The presence of certain immune cells in the tumor microenvironment seem to have an influence on prognosis in DLBCL. In order to develop novel therapies to modulate immune cell infiltration and improve prognosis, there is a need to identify processes/signaling pathways that promote the infiltration of specific immune cells and in addition, understand if there are any key differences in the regulation cells that can be exploited for this purpose. In addition, while the mechanism of action is still unclear, preliminary data suggests that STING protein promotes a favorable prognosis in DLBCL. Understanding the role STING plays in immune cell infiltration would help us characterize the features of a ‘high-STING’ tumor to understand how this protein promotes a favorable prognosis. Overall, the objectives of this project are to understand the intracellular signals that regulate immune phenotypes in DLBCL and the role of STING in promoting a favorable prognosis and its regulation of immune cell infiltration. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Modulation of the immune system plays a key role in modern cancer treatment (Pulendran &amp; Davis, 2020). DLBCL is the most common aggressive lymphoma, affecting both young and elderly adults (Li, Young, &amp; Medeiros, 2018). The prognosis of DLBCL is influenced by the immune microenvironment which plays a key role in the prognosis of DLBCL (Autio et al., 2021). For instance, M2 macrophages might have a lymphoma-promoting function in DLBCL and predict poor clinical outcomes, unlike M1 macrophages (Nam et al., 2014). Using bioinformatic techniques we can then gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells. To facilitate the investigation of the roles of various immune cells in tumors, various computational methods (Abbas, Wolslegel, Seshasayee, Modrusan, &amp; Clark, 2009) have been developed, particularly for deconvoluting bulk gene expression profiles that will allow us to estimate various cell compositions. The idea behind such computational approaches is to treat bulk expression profiles as a linear or additive combination of the expression profiles of several cell subsets, and thus recover the fractions of different types of cells. Applying immune deconvolution algorithms on DLBCL datasets would allow us to examine the fraction of immune cells present in tumor samples and hence help us gauge the extent of immune cell infiltration. Further downstream bioinformatic analysis such as Gene set enrichment or pathway analysis can help us gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells. Chemotherapy treatment has also been found to play a role in immune cell recruitment. A key mediator of chemotherapy-induced immune signaling is the Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway mediates the interplay between the cytotoxic effect and immune stimulation by detecting DNA damage-induced micronuclei or cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and promoting antitumor immune responses (Valmori et al., 2002). Understanding the role of STING in mediating an immune response as a cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensor would give us insight into the immune microenvironment in the context of DLBCL. Further, we have preliminary evidence that indicates that STING promote a favorable prognosis in DLBCL thus we reasoned that this protein could be a key determinant of immunogenicity in DLBCL "],["1-rmd-basics.html", "Chapter 1 Methodology 1.1 Datasets 1.2 Immunedeconvolution 1.3 Pathway Analysis 1.4 STING correlation analysis 1.5 Statistical analysis 1.6 Clustering analysis", " Chapter 1 Methodology 1.1 Datasets The following whole genome RNA-Seq DLBCL datasets were compiled for analysis and validation - GOYA DLBCL dataset This dataset contains collected RNASeq data of 552 samples from the GOYA clinical trial. The GOYA trial tested the efficacy of Gazyva (GA101) compared with Rituxan (Rituximab) in first line, untreated DLBCL patients (Nowicka et al., 2021). Dave dataset This dataset contain exome sequencing data for 1001 DLBCL patients and RNA sequencing data for 775 DLBCL patients (Reddy et al., 2017). Staudt dataset This retrospective study included 181 clinical samples from CHOP-treated patients and 233 clinical samples from Rituximab-CHOP-treated patients (Schmitz et al., 2018). The following microarray datasets were choosen for analysis - 1.2 Immunedeconvolution Immune deconvolution by the following methods was conducted for the chosen datasets. quanTIseq CIBERSORT MCP - Counter xCell EPIC 1.3 Pathway Analysis CIBERSORT results were chosen for further downstream analysis due to better resolution of the immune subtypes. For each immune subtype, the patient samples were divided into two cohorts (high and low) based on the immune cell subtype infiltration score (CIBERSORT Score). DeSeq223 analysis was conducted to find the differentially expressed genes following which Gene Set Enrichment24 Analysis using Hallmark gene sets was performed. R 4.1.1 and GraphPad PRISM 9 were used for visualization. 1.4 STING correlation analysis The CIBERSORT Score for each immune cell type was divided into quartiles (CIBERSORT high (Q4), Interquartile range (IQR) and CIBERSORT low (Q1)) and correlated with STING TPM counts for each dataset. Violin plots were used to visualize the results. STING expression for each dataset was divided into quartiles and GSEA analysis was performed between Quartile 1 and Quartile 4 in each of the microarray datasets in order to evaluate pathway level differences. 1.5 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics and one way ANOVA tests were conducted using GraphPad PRISM 9 software for evaluating statistical significance of each quartile. FDR &lt; 0.05 and p value &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant for GSEA and GO analysis. Pearson correlation was conducted using R 4.1.1. 1.6 Clustering analysis 25 FGES (Functional Gene Enrichment Signatures) signatures38 were used to identify microenvironmental patterns among DLBCL samples, stratified by STING expression (quartile 4 being STING High samples and quartile 1 Low STING samples) by unsupervised dense clustering using the Louvain method for community detection. Datasets GSE117556, GSE32918, GSE10846, GSE23501 and GSE31312 were individually analyzed and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) was conducted to generate activity scores. Intersample similarity of the activity scores was calculated using Pearson correlation. The resulting distance matrix was converted into a graph where each sample formed a node and two nodes formed an edge with weight equal to the pair’s Pearson correlation. To mathematically determine the optimum threshold for observed clusters for each dataset, maximum Calinski Harabasz and Silhouette scores were used excluding separations with low-populated clusters. The Calinski-Harabasz index, also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion, is the ratio of the sum of between-clusters dispersion and of inter-cluster dispersion for all clusters, the higher the score, the better the performance. This score is fast to compute and the score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated. Silhouette Coefficient or silhouette score is a metric used to calculate the goodness of a clustering technique. Its value ranges from -1 to 1. WIth 1 meaning the clusters are well apart from each other and clearly distinguished. 0 meaning the clusters are indifferent and -1 meaning the clusters are assigned in the wrong way. The Silhouette score was used as validation after computing the Calinski-Harabasz index and optimum threshold was decided. "],["2-results-and-discussion.html", "Chapter 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Pathway Analysis 2.2 STING cGAS Pathway 2.3 STING Analysis", " Chapter 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Pathway Analysis By applying GSEA to the GOYA RNA Seq dataset, we obtain a broad overview of the enriched pathways in ‘immune cell type rich’ versus ‘immune cell type poor’ samples. Normalized enrichment scores (NES) were plotted for each pathway with the size of the data point representing the number of genes enriched for that pathway. A higher NES indicates a more significant enrichment of the pathway. The data points were colour coded with respect to the p-value with the lighter shade implying higher p value and lower statistically significance. DLBCL arises from the germinal center and shows two distinct subtypes: germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are derived from normal germinal-center centroblasts whereas Activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are derived from plasmablasts27. Certain transformations of the GCB result in malignancy such as deregulation of BCL2, PI3K/mTOR pathway, p53 mutations and MDM2 gain/amplification28. Deregulation of anti apoptotic BCL2 leads to overexpression of BCL2, making the cell resist cell death. ABC DLBCL however, shows constitutive activation of the oncogenic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway as well as de-regulation BCL2 protein28. NF-κB activity is required for normal B cell development and survival. Lymphoid malignancies typically circumvent cell death by activation of the NFkB pathway. In particular for B cells, NFkB activation is seen downstream of several receptors including BCR, CD40, the B-cell–activating factor (BAFF) receptor, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs)29 BCL6, a transcription repressor is also known to play a causative role in lymphomagenesis. STAT3 is a negative transcriptional regulator of BCL6. Sustained STAT3 activity (for proliferation and survival) is seen in ABC DLBCL cells, suggesting that chemoresistance and consequently poorer outcomes, exhibited by ABC DLBCL could be determined by simultaneous activation of both NFkB and STAT328,30 Further, lymphocytes and lymphoid malignancies depend on cytokine stimulation for growth and survival. B cell microenvironment interaction is influenced by cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 4, IL6, IL10 and IL2131 The GSEA comparisons (Supplementary Material Fig 1a-h) are for DLBCL with high immune cell infiltration vs low immune cell infiltration. Merdan et al 32 evaluated the CIBERSORT deconvolution scores for different immune subtypes and stratified the scores according to clinical risk groups. They established an association between the relative proportions of the immune cell types within subgroups of DLBCL patients by various clinical traits including cell of origin. It was seen that M0 macrophages, memory resting CD4 + T-cells and CD8+ T cells show greater infiltration particularly in GCB DLBCL samples. This could suggest that the pathways (such as complement, inflammatory response for M0, response to DNA damage for CD4+ memory resting and interferon gamma and alpha for CD8+ T cells) that show greater enrichment than STAT3 and NFkB (which are the pathways active in ABC DLBCL) could represent pathways active in GCB DLBCL that drive the infiltration of these cell types. 2.2 STING cGAS Pathway Figure 2.1: STING Pathway Abnormal localization of DNA in the cytosol elicits an immune response through the cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS binds to DNA in the cytosol and converts ATP and GTP into 2′3′-cGAMP. cGAMP then binds to STING on the ER to trigger STING trafficking to vesicles. cGAMP-bound STING activates the downstream kinases TBK1 and IKK to activate the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively. These transcription factors induce expression of type I IFNs and cytokines, which propagate the immune response in an autocrine and paracrine manner33 2.3 STING Analysis Through an investigation evaluating the prognostic significance of a set of immunological features reflective of innate and adaptive immunity in DLBCL, the Jeyasekharan lab identified the inflammatory mediator STING as being correlated with a favourable prognosis. The correlation between STING expression and immune cell infiltration was examined for three RNA Seq datasets. The CIBERSORT Scores for each immune cell was divided into CIBERSORT high quartile (Q4), Interquartile range (IQR) and CIBERSORT low quartile (Q1). The TPM counts for STING expression was plotted as a continuous variable for each quartile and one way ANOVA and subsequent p value was used to determine statistical significance.

One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You’ll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and R Markdown will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No need for you to remember! So that you don’t have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple R functions have been created for you to assist. You’ll see their use below. In the R chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as reed.jpg in our main directory. We then give it the caption of “Reed logo,” the label of “reedlogo,” and specify that this is a figure. Make note of the different R chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document). include_graphics(path = &quot;figure/reed.jpg&quot;) Figure 3.1: Reed logo Here is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure 3.1. Note the use of the fig: code here. By naming the R chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option fig.cap. Below we will investigate how to save the output of an R plot and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the flights dataset from Chapter 1. (Note that we’ve shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014. mean_delay_by_carrier &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(carrier) %&gt;% summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) ggplot(mean_delay_by_carrier, aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;identity&quot;, stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 3.2: Mean Delays by Airline Here is a reference to this image: Figure 3.2. A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv. Next, we will explore the use of the out.extra chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by specifying \"scale= \". Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the “subdivision.pdf” file. Figure 3.3: Subdiv. graph Here is a reference to this image: Figure 3.3. Note that echo=FALSE is specified so that the R code is hidden in the document. More Figure Stuff Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the out.extra chunk option.

Endnotes work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on the CUS site or feel free to reach out to data@reed.edu. 3.3 Bibliographies Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. The Reed librarians have created Zotero documentation at https://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero. In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at https://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/. R Markdown uses pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) to build its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won’t have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the “at” symbol. For example, here’s a reference to a book about worrying: (Molina1994?). This Molina1994 entry appears in a file called thesis.bib in the bib folder. This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the bib folder. For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site (https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html)2. There are three pages on this topic: bibtex (which talks about using BibTeX, at https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html), bibtexstyles (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html) and bibman (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources. If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style files at https://www.zotero.org/styles. Make sure to download the file into the csl folder. Tips for Bibliographies Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination. The cite key (a citation’s label) needs to be unique from the other entries. When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author’s name by the word “and” e.g. Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},. Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary. To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces. You can add a Reed Thesis citation3 option. The best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use the optional “type” field to enter “Reed thesis” or “Undergraduate thesis.” 3.4 Anything else?
