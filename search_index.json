And while at first he very rarely discouraged going down new paths, he became quick to warn me against rabbit holes when he realized my inability to avoid them. His occasionally uncanny insights often lead me to wonder whether he’s been hiding the answers all along. My co-advisor Dr Patrick Jaynes is always willing to provide feedback on everything I write, however hopeless or trivial the draft may be. I very much appreciate his thoughtfulness in asking just the right questions whenever I lack the capacity for words. I must also thank the patience and ingenuity of anyone who’s ever taught me. While I won’t rattle off all of my teachers since preschool, I am certaintly grateful to every one of my teachers since preschool. Objective The broad scope of this project is to correlate gene signatures with the infiltration of specific immune cell types. The presence of certain immune cells in the tumor microenvironment seem to have an influence on prognosis in DLBCL. In order to develop novel therapies to modulate immune cell infiltration and improve prognosis, there is a need to identify processes/signaling pathways that promote the infiltration of specific immune cells and in addition, understand if there are any key differences in the regulation cells that can be exploited for this purpose. In addition, while the mechanism of action is still unclear, preliminary data suggests that STING protein promotes a favorable prognosis in DLBCL. Understanding the role STING plays in immune cell infiltration would help us characterize the features of a ‘high-STING’ tumor to understand how this protein promotes a favorable prognosis. Overall, the objectives of this project are to understand the intracellular signals that regulate immune phenotypes in DLBCL and the role of STING in promoting a favorable prognosis and its regulation of immune cell infiltration. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Modulation of the immune system plays a key role in modern cancer treatment¹. DLBCL is the most common aggressive lymphoma, affecting both young and elderly adults². The prognosis of DLBCL is influenced by the immune microenvironment which plays a key role in the prognosis of DLBCL³. For instance, M2 macrophages might have a lymphoma-promoting function in DLBCL and predict poor clinical outcomes, unlike M1 macrophages⁴ .Using bioinformatic techniques we can then gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells.’ To facilitate the investigation of the roles of various immune cells in tumors, various computational methods5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 have been developed, particularly for deconvoluting bulk gene expression profiles that will allow us to estimate various cell compositions. The idea behind such computational approaches is to treat bulk expression profiles as a linear or additive combination of the expression profiles of several cell subsets, and thus recover the fractions of different types of cells. Applying immune deconvolution algorithms on DLBCL datasets would allow us to examine the fraction of immune cells present in tumor samples and hence help us gauge the extent of immune cell infiltration. Further downstream bioinformatic analysis such as Gene set enrichment or pathway analysis can help us gain insight into the pathways that regulate the infiltration of various immune cells. Chemotherapy treatment has also been found to play a role in immune cell recruitment. A key mediator of chemotherapy-induced immune signaling is the Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway mediates the interplay between the cytotoxic effect and immune stimulation by detecting DNA damage-induced micronuclei or cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and promoting antitumor immune responses13. Understanding the role of STING in mediating an immune response as a cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensor would give us insight into the immune microenvironment in the context of DLBCL. Further, we have preliminary evidence that indicates that STING promote a favorable prognosis in DLBCL thus we reasoned that this protein could be a key determinant of immunogenicity in DLBCL "],["1-rmd-basics.html", "Chapter 1 Methodology 1.1 Immunedeconvolution", " Chapter 1 Methodology 1.1 Immunedeconvolution Whole genome RNA-Seq DLBCL datasets were compiled for analysis and validation. Immune deconvolution by various methods was conducted for the chosen datasets. GOYA DLBCL dataset This dataset contains collected RNASeq data of 552 samples from the GOYA clinical trial. The GOYA trial tested the efficacy of Gazyva (GA101) compared with Rituxan (Rituximab) in first line, untreated DLBCL patients. Dave dataset This dataset contain exome sequencing data for 1001 DLBCL patients and RNA sequencing data for 775 DLBCL patients.

Donald Knuth designed  when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics. One nice feature of R Markdown is its ability to read LaTeX code directly. If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section which has been commented out. If you’re not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section. 2.2 Chemistry 101: Symbols Chemical formulas will look best if they are not italicized. Get around math mode’s automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument $\\mathrm{formula here}$, with your formula inside the curly brackets. (Notice the use of the backticks here which enclose text that acts as code.) So, \\(\\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}\\) is written $\\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$. Exponent or Superscript: \\(\\mathrm{O^-}\\) Subscript: \\(\\mathrm{CH_4}\\) To stack numbers or letters as in \\(\\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}\\), the subscript is defined first, and then the superscript is defined. Bullet: CuCl \\(\\bullet\\) \\(\\mathrm{7H_{2}O}\\) Delta: \\(\\Delta\\) Reaction Arrows: \\(\\longrightarrow\\) or \\(\\xrightarrow{solution}\\) Resonance Arrows: \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) Reversible Reaction Arrows: \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) 2.2.1 Typesetting reactions You may wish to put your reaction in an equation environment, which means that LaTeX will place the reaction where it fits and will number the equations for you. \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{6CO_2 + 6H_2O} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] We can reference this combustion of glucose reaction via Equation (2.1). 2.2.2 Other examples of reactions \\(\\mathrm{NH_4Cl_{(s)}}\\) \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) \\(\\mathrm{NH_{3(g)}+HCl_{(g)}}\\) \\(\\mathrm{MeCH_2Br + Mg}\\) \\(\\xrightarrow[below]{above}\\) \\(\\mathrm{MeCH_2\\bullet Mg \\bullet Br}\\) 2.3 Physics Many of the symbols you will need can be found on the math page https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/math.html and the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol Guide (https://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf). 2.4 Biology You will probably find the resources at https://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html helpful, particularly the links to bsts for various journals. You may also be interested in TeXShade for nucleotide typesetting (https://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/txe.html). Be sure to read the proceeding chapter on graphics and tables. "],["3-ref-labels.html", "Chapter 3 Graphics, References, and Labels 3.1 Figures 3.2 Footnotes and Endnotes 3.3 Bibliographies 3.4 Anything else?", " Chapter 3 Graphics, References, and Labels 3.1 Figures blah lbah lab u If your thesis has a lot of figures, R Markdown might behave better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You’ll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and R Markdown will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No need for you to remember! So that you don’t have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple R functions have been created for you to assist. You’ll see their use below. In the R chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as reed.jpg in our main directory. We then give it the caption of “Reed logo,” the label of “reedlogo,” and specify that this is a figure. Make note of the different R chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document). include_graphics(path = &quot;figure/reed.jpg&quot;) Figure 3.1: Reed logo Here is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure 3.1. Note the use of the fig: code here. By naming the R chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option fig.cap. Below we will investigate how to save the output of an R plot and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the flights dataset from Chapter 1. (Note that we’ve shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014. mean_delay_by_carrier &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(carrier) %&gt;% summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) ggplot(mean_delay_by_carrier, aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;identity&quot;, stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 3.2: Mean Delays by Airline Here is a reference to this image: Figure 3.2. A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv. Next, we will explore the use of the out.extra chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by specifying \"scale= \". Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the “subdivision.pdf” file. Figure 3.3: Subdiv. graph Here is a reference to this image: Figure 3.3. Note that echo=FALSE is specified so that the R code is hidden in the document. More Figure Stuff Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the out.extra chunk option. (Currently this only works in the PDF version of the book.) Figure 3.4: A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down As another example, here is a reference: Figure 3.4. 3.2 Footnotes and Endnotes You might want to footnote something.1 The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on the CUS site or feel free to reach out to data@reed.edu. 3.3 Bibliographies Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. The Reed librarians have created Zotero documentation at https://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero. In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at https://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/. R Markdown uses pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) to build its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won’t have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the “at” symbol. For example, here’s a reference to a book about worrying: (Molina &amp; Borkovec, 1994). This Molina1994 entry appears in a file called thesis.bib in the bib folder. This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the bib folder. For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site (https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html)2. There are three pages on this topic: bibtex (which talks about using BibTeX, at https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html), bibtexstyles (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html) and bibman (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources. If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style files at https://www.zotero.org/styles. Make sure to download the file into the csl folder. Tips for Bibliographies Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination. The cite key (a citation’s label) needs to be unique from the other entries. When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author’s name by the word “and” e.g. Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},. Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary. To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces. You can add a Reed Thesis citation3 option. The best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use the optional “type” field to enter “Reed thesis” or “Undergraduate thesis.” 3.4 Anything else?

More info And here’s some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head shouldn’t be indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you’re starting a new paragraph. Since that’s obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn’t add an indent there.
